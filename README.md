This is a simple program with small frontend and backend to download multiple videos to mp3 files from a playlist.

To start, install the requirements by:
```python3 -m venv venv```
```source venv/bin/activate  # or equivalent for your OS```
```pip install -r requirements.txt```


or just activate the already existing environment after installation

If this is done, run ```npm install```
and start the program by running ```./start.sh```

You should be all set now, a little UI should pop up in your browser with the necessary fields.
